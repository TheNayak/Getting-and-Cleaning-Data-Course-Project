This Codebook will explain the interpretation of all the variable names and data manipulations in the R script run_analysis.R and 
the final step text file submission (tidy_average.txt).

Have a look at the run_analysis.R script, 
For the script to run you will have to read and assign the following eight files (raw data;Space seperated variables) to the
following variables:

1)activity_labels.txt        ---->        activity_labels    (6 rows 2 colomns)
2)features.txt               ---->        features           (561 rows 2 colomns)
3)subject_test.txt           ---->        subject_test       (2947 rows 1 colomns)
4)subject_train.txt          ---->        subject_train      (7352 rows 1 colomns)
5)X_test.txt                 ---->        X_test             (2947 rows 561 colomns)
6)X_train.txt                ---->        X_train            (7352 rows 561 colomns)
7)y_test.txt                 ---->        y_test             (2947 rows 1 variable)
8)y_train.txt                ---->        y_train            (7352 rows 1 variable)

Some interpretations:
1)activity_labels.txt has 6 different activities and its code as follows:
  1 WALKING
  2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS
  3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
  4 SITTING
  5 STANDING
  6 LAYING

2)the features.txt contains colomn names for X_train and X_test and interpretations as follows:
  The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 
  Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 
  Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 
  These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
   
   '-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

   tBodyAcc-XYZ
   tGravityAcc-XYZ
   tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
   tBodyGyro-XYZ
   tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
   tBodyAccMag
   tGravityAccMag
   tBodyAccJerkMag
   tBodyGyroMag
   tBodyGyroJerkMag
   fBodyAcc-XYZ
   fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
   fBodyGyro-XYZ
   fBodyAccMag
   fBodyAccJerkMag
   fBodyGyroMag
   fBodyGyroJerkMag

   The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

   mean(): Mean value
   std(): Standard deviation
   mad(): Median absolute deviation 
   max(): Largest value in array
   min(): Smallest value in array
   sma(): Signal magnitude area
   energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values. 
   iqr(): Interquartile range 
   entropy(): Signal entropy
   arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4
   correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals
   maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
   meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
   skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal 
   kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal 
   bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.
   angle(): Angle between to vectors.

   Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

   gravityMean
   tBodyAccMean
   tBodyAccJerkMean
   tBodyGyroMean
   tBodyGyroJerkMean

3) The subject_test.txt and subject_train.txt contain values fron 1-30 that represent the particular human subject taking the test.

4) The X_test.txt and X_train.txt contain variables based on the colomn names in the features.txt file.

5) The y_test.txt and y_train.txt contain the activity codes for each observation.
