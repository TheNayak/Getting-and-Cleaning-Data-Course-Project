# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

The repository contains four files:

1)Readme.md

2)Codebook.md : This contains the explaination and interpretation of all the variable names and data manipulations done.

3)run_analysis.R : The R script used to obtain tidy data.

4)tidy_avg.txt : the final submission.

Please have a look at the codebook while going thru the R script.

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing.

Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.
  
Here are the data for the project:

I have created a R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:

1)Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

2)Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

3)Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

4)Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

5)From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity     and each subject.
